## Simulate the Diffusion Decision Model

This Shiny web app illustrates how changing drift, boundary, and start point bias parameters in the 
standard drift diffusion model affects choice probabilities and response time distributions. In this app,
a reference simulated dataset is generated with set parametes and a second simulated dataset 
is generated using the parameters specified in the interface. The reference dataset is meant to facilitate comparison.
